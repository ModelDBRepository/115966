Title: A sample program for the internal clock model
Contributor: Tadashi Yamazaki(yamazaki)
Free Keywords: 
  random recurrent inhibitory network
   cerebellum
   granular layer
Comment: 
  This is our re-implementation of the cerebellar model presented in the
  following paper:
  
      Tadashi Yamazaki and Shigeru Tanaka (2005),
      Neural Modeling of an Internal Clock.
      Neural Computation 17(5) 1032--1058.
  
  One can set parameters arbitrarily and simulate the network dynamics.
  
  Please notice that this program is independent of the original version
  developed by Yamazaki and Tanaka (2005).
